#See it, Click it, Buy it.

##Problem Statement
Recognizing a product from an image is a tough problem especially when the search is done from mobile devices. As a consumer, I want to look at an item that I like, and buy it online via my phone.

##Proposed Solution
To solve above mentioned problem , I built an iOS app that helps user to buy an item that they come across by clicking a picture of the item which is then analyzed using a existing image recognition service to find out all the possible things the image could contain, and then the tag with the highest possibility (largest probability value) is used to search e-commerce APIs to display products.

##Future prospects
Improve image recognition by allowing uses to verify if the item was identified correctly. The app continues to suggest the user with possible websites having the the same object.

##Technologies Used
Swift, IBM Bluemix API

##Domain
E-Commerce.
